# 🛡 Cybersecurity Projects

This repository contains my projects, scripts, labs, and notes in **cybersecurity**.  
It includes both **offensive security** (pentesting, red teaming, exploit development) and **defensive security** (risk, compliance, SOC operations).  

I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Cybersecurity at The George Washington University and will keep updating this repo as I learn more.
