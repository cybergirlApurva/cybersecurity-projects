🛡 CyberSentinels: A Cybersecurity Portfolio

A living repository of my cybersecurity journey — from theory to practice, offense to defense

"In cybersecurity, the only constant is evolution. This repository documents my growth, experiments, and contributions to the field."

📍 About the Architect

I'm a Master's candidate in Cybersecurity at The George Washington University, building this knowledge repository as I bridge academic theory with practical implementation. This space evolves weekly with new discoveries, code, and research.

📈 Repository Evolution

This isn't a static portfolio but a living document of my cybersecurity journey. You can trace my development through:

· Commit history showing technique refinement
· Project evolution from concept to implementation
· Increasing complexity of research and testing methodologies

---

⚠️ Responsible Disclosure & Ethics

All offensive security research is conducted:

· In controlled lab environments without public internet access
· Against systems I own or have explicit permission to test
· With the goal of improving defensive capabilities

This repository contains no actual exploits, sensitive information, or compromised data. Techniques are documented for educational purposes to strengthen community knowledge.

---

🔗 Connect & Collaborate

I welcome discussions on:

· Security research collaboration
· Technique validation and peer review
· Defensive countermeasure development
· Academic research in cybersecurity

Let's build a more secure digital world together.
